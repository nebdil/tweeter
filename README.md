# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone where I built upon it to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills. If you want to send a tweet, you just click on COMPOSE and start writing. If you are over the letter limit, the app will let you know. If you did not write anything, but tried to submit a tweet, the app will let you know again. You can also see other people's tweets and like them with the heart icon. Now let's get tweeting!
